  <Name>k__BackingField: Two Number Sum
  <Description>k__BackingField: 'Write a program which adds two numbers given by
    inputs and outputs the result.


    For the whole solution:

    - Allocate
    only one data block (one instance of DAT)

    - Use the OTC instruction and
    the ASCII chart to print a formatted output (A+B=C)'
  <BaseCode>k__BackingField: A DAT
  <Input>k__BackingField:
  - 60
  - 9
  <Hints>k__BackingField:
  - Read the instruction set to be familiar with all the opcodes and the operands
    they use.<br><br>Help > Instruction Set
  - Make use of the "ADD" instruction, which will add a number which is stored in
    the address that is passed to it as an operand.
  - Make sure to store the first number using STA before asking for inputting the
    second number.
